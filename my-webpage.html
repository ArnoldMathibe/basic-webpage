            <img src="images/paris.jpg" alt="">
            <p>I want to visit paris, as it is one of the beautiful cities in the world, 
                it is also one of the most romantic cities in Europe, many people even call it
                "City OF Love" and also people love visiting it.</p>

            <p>One of the most famous places to get a view is at the Eiffel Tower,
                another thing i wish to do, is to get on top of the Eiffel Tower, and 
                view the city all the way from the top, and I'd got on top using stairs</p>

            <p>When I am done with Eiffel Tower, then I'll head on to climb Sacré-Cœur, 
                I hear they say the view from there is better than the famous Eiffel Tower, 
                so i would like to experience that.
